== 6. Shadows

For this chapter, an arithmetic expression is either an atom (including numbers), i.e, `*` or `9`, or two expressions combined by `+`, `*` or `â†‘`, something like `9 + 1`.

`(quote +)` is the atom `+`, , not the operation `+`. The same holds true for other operators like `*`, `/`, etc.

`(n + 3)` is not an arithmetic expression because our earlier definition of arithmetic expression does not include parenthesis.

These is an invalid arithmetic expressions by our definition:

----
(3 + 5 * (2 + 3))
----

It should be like this instead:

----
(3 + (5 * (2 + 3)))
----

If we do `(cdr (cdr (+ 1 2)))` we get `(2)`, and that is not a sub-expression of our entire arithmetic expression; `2` would though, and `(car (cdr (cdr (+ 1 2))))` would be the proper way to access it. That is what we do in the next example as well.
