=== About Sets

A Set is an unordered collection of objects without duplicates.

Two sets are the same if they have the same members (which may be in different order).

A subset is a set in which its members are part of another set. Two equal sets also mean that one set is a subset of the other, and vice-versa.

Two sets intersect if they contain at least one common member.

The union of two sets is the combination of elements in both sets.

=== function: `eqset?'

=== function: `intersect?'

.`intersect?' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----

Note that `subset?` uses `and`, and `intersect?` uses `or`, otherwise they are the same thing.

Pay attention to those instances where we don't return an empty list for the base case (as in those number-related function in which we returned `n` instead of `0`).
