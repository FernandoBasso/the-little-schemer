== 4. Numbers Games

Numbers are atoms, but for this book we only consider non-negative numbers (Natural Set), and ignore negative and floating point numbers.

For this book `(sub1 0)` is a “no answer” thing, but it practice it would produce `-1`.

We broke the first commandment as we did not use `null?`. Still asking `zero?` of a number is somewhat like asking `null?` of a list.

`zero?` is like `null?` and `add1` (builds numbers) is like `cons` (builds lists).
